Tiny Tastes

Purpose
The iOS for iPad app Tiny Tastes will be an animated story in which a child can open the app and become acquainted with the story of a cute, fun critter friend that he/she can bond with. This story will also be interactive at parts with the child making choices at critical points in the story, thus changing the sequence of events and creating a unique experience every time. At the end of this introductory story, the user -- most likely, the child’s parent or caregiver -- will be prompted to snap a picture of the food that the child has in front of him/her. The user will also be prompted to input a goal time limit for this mealtime.			

Then, that picture will be transposed onto the animated critter’s bowl, and the critter and the child can eat the food together. As time progresses, the food in the critter’s bowl will disappear portion by portion. When the timer is up, the user will input whether the child finished his meal or not. If the answer is affirmative, the user will be taken to a “congratulatory” screen with positive feedback.

Dependencies
You will need at least XCode 5 and iOS 7 to run the app.

Deployment
To deploy the app, clone the project from this repository and open the project using XCode. You will need XCode 5+ in order to run it. From there, you can either open it using the Simulator (note that it must be the iPad Retina simulation since the other versions are not supported), or by deploying it to an iPad with the appropriate licensing and permissions.
