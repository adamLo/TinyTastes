Tiny Tastes
===========

Purpose
-------
The iOS for iPad app Tiny Tastes will be an animated story in which a child can open the app and become acquainted with the story of a cute, fun critter friend that he/she can bond with. This story will also be interactive at parts with the child making choices at critical points in the story, thus changing the sequence of events and creating a unique experience every time. At the end of this introductory story, the user -- most likely, the child’s parent or caregiver -- will be prompted to snap a picture of the food that the child has in front of him/her. The user will also be prompted to input a goal time limit for this mealtime.			

Then, that picture will be transposed onto the animated critter’s bowl, and the critter and the child can eat the food together. As time progresses, the food in the critter’s bowl will disappear portion by portion. When the timer is up, the user will input whether the child finished his meal or not. If the answer is affirmative, the user will be taken to a “congratulatory” screen with positive feedback.

Dependencies
------------
You will need at least XCode 5 and iOS 7 to run the app.

Deployment
----------
To deploy the app, clone the project from this repository and open the project using XCode. You will need XCode 5+ in order to run it. From there, you can either open it using the Simulator (note that it must be the iPad Retina simulation since the other versions are not supported), or by deploying it to an iPad with the appropriate licensing and permissions.

Future Features
---------------
The main feature the client wishes to develop in the future is the addition of the Tiny Store. This will be an in-app store where the user can trade in coins for cool/useful items that will then show up in the story or on the Choose Drink/Eat screens. Possible ideas for this include different characters that the user can swap out in Story Mode, different colors/styles of plates, cups, and utensils, and clothes/accessories for Tiny the Kangaroo.

The client also wishes to add the feature of multiple accounts within the app, where each account saves user preferences and app progress. This feature is useful for a family with more than one children but only one iPad.

The client also will be adding story book images and sounds as they are illustrated, but this functionality is already in place within the code, so this part should be very simple. The process of adding these story pages is explained in great detail in the Programmer Transfer Documentation.

Release notes
-------------
Tiny Tastes currently only works on iOS 7 on an iPad Retina, and only works with XCode 5. It features a rich story mode with sweet animations and graphics, has support for the user taking a picture of the child's food with a camera which is then transposed onto the screen and slowly eaten by the character, and a settings screen which can edit the app settings such as toggling the sound and push reminders.
