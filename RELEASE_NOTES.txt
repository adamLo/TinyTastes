Tiny Tastes currently only works on iOS 7 on an iPad Retina, and only works with XCode 5. It features a rich story mode with sweet animations and graphics, has support for the user taking a picture of the child's food with a camera which is then transposed onto the screen and slowly eaten by the character, and a settings screen which can edit the app settings such as toggling the sound and push reminders.
